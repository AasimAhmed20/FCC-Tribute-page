      <h2 id="headline">Here's a time line of Lady Lovelace life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1815</strong>-Born in London,England.</li>
        <li><strong>1823</strong>-At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.</li>
        <li><strong>1829</strong>-she was paralysed after a bout of measles.</li>
        <li><strong>1831</strong>-she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her
          mathematical and technological skills.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1832</strong>-when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[26] and her
          interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan
          suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become "an original mathematical
          investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence".
        </li>
        <li><strong>1834</strong>-Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and
          was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse,
          Byron's friend, described her as "a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's
          features, particularly the mouth".
        </li>
        <li><strong>1835</strong>-she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King.</li>
        <li><strong>1842-1843</strong>- Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on
          Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.
          With the article, she appended a set of notes.Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult
          task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown
          little interest in it.
          Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.
          Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her
          writing.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1844</strong>-she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical
          model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings ("a calculus of the nervous
          system").She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running
          pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this
          project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical
          experiments.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1851</strong>-On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to Charles Babbage
          asking him to be her executor.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1852</strong>-Dies at the age of 36.</li>
        <li><strong>1953</strong>-More than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical
          Engine were republished as an appendix to B.V. Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing
          Machines.The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a
          description of a computer and software.
